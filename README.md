Some convenient scripts for file management

## find-bad-1080.ps1
A Powershell script to find MKV files that are 1080p but are encoded in H.264.

Generated by ChatGPT, refined with iteration.  Only manual changes were changing
the first filter pattern from `resolution: 1920x1080` to `Pixel height: 1080`
and removing piping the errors to the log file.  Assumes that `mkvinfo` is
installed at `C:\Program Files\MKVToolNix\mkvinfo.exe` and will search the
current directory and all subdirectories for MKV files that meet the criteria,
writing their names to the terminal and to `./mkv_info.log`.
